# 🚁 Aerial Object Detection (Drones vs. Birds)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered detection system designed to distinguish between **Drones** and **Birds** in aerial imagery. Built using the state-of-the-art **YOLOv11** architecture, it aims to enhance airspace security and wildlife monitoring by providing high-accuracy, real-time classification.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The model was trained and validated on a specialized dataset hosted on Roboflow, featuring diverse environmental conditions and lighting.
- **Source:** Roboflow Universe
- **Dataset Link:** [Bird vs Drone Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/elif-nar/bird-vs-drone-izmwp)
- **Classes:** `Bird`, `Drone`

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning Framework:** YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit
